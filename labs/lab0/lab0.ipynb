    "\n",
    "We began by starting a notebook server instance in the terminal by running\n",

    "[I 08:58:24.417 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last message included here indicates the URL the application is being served at. The default behaviour of the ``jupyter notebook`` command is to open a tab in a web browser pointing to this address after the server has started up.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the notebook server is running it will continue printing log messages to the terminal it was started from. Unless you detach the process from the terminal session you will need to keep the session open to keep the notebook server alive. If you want to close down a running server instance from the terminal you can use ``<ctrl>+c``:\n",
    "- On DICE (or other Linux distribution) this will bring up a confirmation message asking you to confirm you wish to shut the server down. You can either enter ``y`` or skip the confirmation by hitting ``<ctrl>+c`` again. \n",

    "The dashboard is showing the ``Files`` tab with a list of files in the directory the notebook server was launched from. We can navigate into a sub-directory by clicking on a directory name and back up to the parent directory by clicking the ``..`` link. An important point to note is that the top-most level that you will be able to navigate to is the directory you started to run the server from. This is a security feature and generally, you should try to limit the access the server has by launching it in the highest level directory which gives you access to all the files you need to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as allowing you to launch existing notebooks, we can also view or edit text files such as ``.py`` source files, directly in the browser by opening them from the dashboard. The in-built text-editor is less-featured than a full IDE but is useful for quick edits of source files and previewing data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``Running`` tab of the dashboard gives a list of the currently running notebook instances. This can be useful to keep track of which notebooks are still running and to shutdown (or reopen) old notebook processes when the corresponding tab has been closed."

Displayed alongside this is an indication of the last manual *checkpoint* of the notebook file. On-going changes are auto-saved at regular intervals; the check-point mechanism is mainly meant as a way to recover an earlier version of a notebook after making unwanted changes. Note the default system only currently supports storing a single previous checkpoint despite the ``Revert to checkpoint`` dropdown under the ``File`` menu perhaps suggesting otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--- As well as having options to save and revert to checkpoints, the `File` menu also allows new notebooks to be created in the same directory as the current notebook, a copy of the current notebook to be made and the ability to export the current notebook to various formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Edit` menu contains standard clipboard functions as well as options for reorganising notebook *cells*. Cells are the basic units of notebooks and can contain formatted text like the one you are reading at the moment or runnable code as we will see below. The `Edit` and `Insert` drop-down menus offer various options for moving cells around the notebook, merging and splitting cells and inserting new ones, while the `Cell` menu allows running of code cells and changing cell types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Kernel` menu offers some useful commands for managing the Python process (kernel) running in the notebook. In particular, it provides options for interrupting a busy kernel (useful for example if you realise you have set a slow code cell running with incorrect parameters) and to restart the current kernel. This will cause all variables currently defined in the workspace to be lost but may be necessary to get the kernel back to a consistent state after polluting the namespace with lots of global variables or when trying to run code from an updated module and `reload` is failing to work.\n",

    "To the far right of the menu, a toolbar is a status indicator. When a dark filled circle is shown this means the notebook is currently busy and any further code cell run commands will be queued to happen after the currently running cell has completed. An open status circle indicates the notebook is currently idle.\n",

    "\n",

After the cell is run this is updated to `In [n]:` where `n` is a number corresponding to the current execution counter which is incremented whenever any code cell in the notebook is run. This can, therefore, be used to keep track of the relative order in which cells were the last run. There is no fundamental requirement to run cells in the order they are organised in the notebook, though things will usually be more readable if you keep things in roughly in order!\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately below the input area is the output area. This shows any output produced by the code in the cell. This is dealt with a little bit confusingly in the current Jupyter version.

Immediately below that output to [`stderr`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_.28stderr.29) is displayed. All of the output to `stdout` is displayed together even if there has been output to `stderr` between as shown by the surprising ordering in the output here. \n",

    "There are a wealth of keyboard shortcuts available in the notebook interface. For an exhaustive list see the ``Keyboard Shortcuts`` option under the ``Help`` menu. We will cover a few of those we find most useful below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcuts come in two flavours: those applicable in *command mode*, active when no cell is currently being edited and indicated by a blue highlight around the current cell; those applicable in *edit mode* when the content of a cell is being edited, indicated by a green current cell highlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In edit mode of a code cell, two of the more generically useful keyboard shortcuts are offered by the ``<tab>`` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pressing ``<tab>`` a single time while editing code will bring up suggested completions of what you have typed so far. This is done in a scope aware manner so, for example, typing ``a+<tab>`` in a code cell will come up with a list of objects beginning with ``a`` in the current global namespace, while typing ``np.a+<tab>`` (assuming ``import numpy as np`` has been run already) will bring up a list of objects in the root NumPy namespace beginning with `a`.\n",
    "  * Pressing ``<shift>+<tab>`` once immediately after opening parenthesis of a function or method will cause a tool-tip to appear with the function signature (including argument names and defaults) and its docstring. Pressing ``<shift>+Tab`` twice in succession will cause an expanded version of the same tooltip to appear, useful for longer docstrings. Pressing ``<shift>+<tab>`` four times in succession will cause the information to be instead displayed in a pager docked to bottom of the notebook interface which stays attached even when making further edits to the code cell and so can be useful for keeping documentation visible when editing e.g. to help remember the name of arguments to a function and their purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of useful shortcuts available in both command and edit mode are ``<mod>+Enter`` where ``<mod>`` is one of ``<ctrl>`` (run selected cell), ``<shift>`` (run selected cell and select next) or ``<alt>`` (run selected cell and insert a new cell after).\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful command mode shortcut to know about is the ability to toggle line numbers on and off for a code cell by pressing ``L`` which can be useful when trying to diagnose stack traces printed when an exception is raised or when referring someone else to a section of code.\n",

    "  * `%precision` Set the precision for pretty-printing of floating-point values and NumPy arrays ([more](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html?highlight=matplotlib#magic-precision)).\n",
    "  * `%debug` Activates the interactive debugger in a cell. Run after an exception has been occurred to help diagnose the issue ([more](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html?highlight=matplotlib#magic-debug))."
